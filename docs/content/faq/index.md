# FAQ

## How stable is Docker for GCP

Docker for GCP is stable enough for development and testing, but we currently don't recommend use with production workloads.

## Can I use my own Disk Image?

No, at this time we only support the default Docker Disk Image.

## I have a problem/bug where do I report it?

Send an email to <docker-for-iaas@docker.com> or post to the [Docker for GCP](https://forums.docker.com/c/docker-for-gcp) forums.

## Analytics

The beta version of Docker for GCP sends anonymized analytics to Docker. These analytics are used to monitor beta adoption and are critical to improve Docker for GCP.
