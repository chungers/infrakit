# Docker for AWS and Docker for Azure beta

Docker for AWS lets you quickly setup and configure a working Docker 1.12 swarm-mode install on Amazon Web Services and on Azure.

Docker for AWS and Azure are available in private beta for testing. Theyâ€™re free to use (AWS and Azure will charge for resource use).

Sign up for the beta on [beta.docker.com](https://beta.docker.com/).

## What to know before installing

When setting up Docker for AWS or Azure, you'll be prompted to select manager and worker counts and instance sizes. If you're testing, 1 manager and `small` instances are fine. Both worker count and worker and manager instance size can be changed later, but manager count should not be modified.

When choosing manager count, consider the level of durability you need:

| # of managers  | # of tolerated failures |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 1  | 0  |
| 3  | 1  |
| 5  | 2  |

For more details, check out the rest of the documentation:

 * [Docker for AWS](aws.md)
 * [Docker for Azure](azure.md)
 * [Deploying your Apps](deploy.md)
 * [AWS release notes](aws-release-notes.md)
