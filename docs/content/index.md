# Docker for GCP beta

Docker for GCP lets you quickly set up and configure a working Docker 1.13
swarm-mode install on Google Cloud Platform.

Docker for GCP is private beta ([sign up](https://beta.docker.com/gcp) for access).
It is free to use (GCP will charge for resource usage).

To deploy Docker for GCP, find the latest release in the [Release Notes](gcp/release-notes.md).

For more details, check out the rest of the documentation:

 * [Docker for GCP](gcp/index.md)
 * [Deploying your Apps](deploy.md)
 * [Release notes](gcp/release-notes.md)
